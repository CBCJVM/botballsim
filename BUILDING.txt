The easiest method of building is to use Eclipse.
There are two methods of importing into Eclipse:

1) - File > New > Java Project
   - Click the radio button labeled "Create project from existing source",
      or uncheck the check box labeled "Use default location".
   - Enter the location of the project root in the Directory text box.
   - Select a project name and click Finish.

2) - File > Import
   - General > Existing Projects Into Workspace...
   - Enter the location of the project root in the Project Root text box.
   - Check the only entry and click Finish.

Ant... working on it. It creates class files that like to eat 100% cpu for no apparent reason.
Maybe that's the JRE's fault, but check back later.
