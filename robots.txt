#  How it works:
#   enable=... enables controllers
#  For each controller, the following must be defined:
#   .type = controller code type
#   .icon = icon in the images folder or JAR
#   .model = collision model to use from the models/ folder (no extension)
#   .map = gc for create, none for static, motor#,# for outputs
#   .radius = wheel radius from the center (if map is not gc or none)
#   .factor = output unit/sec to mm/sec (if map is not gc or none)
#               since Create takes speeds in mm/sec, *BC in ticks/sec, HB/RCX in PWM%
#               the standard model uses 0.26316 for ticks/sec -> mm/sec
