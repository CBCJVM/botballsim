# Collision model for generic CBC/CBC2/XBC/RCX/HB model

# How it works:
# Format is similar to robots.txt
# The entry named "base" will be the model used from this file
#  It may reference sub-models which are specified with other names
#  First line is the base shape
#  Subsequent lines consist of an operation and then a sub-model or prim
# Operations: add, subtract, intersect, xor
# Primitives are: ellipse, rect, poly
#  Ellipse: ellipse, x, y, width, height
#  Rectangle: rect, x, y, width, height
#  Polygon: poly, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, ...
#   It will be implicitly closed
