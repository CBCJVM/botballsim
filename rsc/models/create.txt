# Collision model for Create

# How it works:
# Format is similar to robots.txt
# The entry named "base" will be the model used from this file
#  It may reference sub-models which are specified with other names
#  First line is the base shape
#  Subsequent lines consist of an operation and then a sub-model or prim
# Operations: add, subtract, intersect, xor
# Primitives are: ellipse, rect, poly
#  Ellipse: ellipse, x, y, width, height
#  Rectangle: rect, x, y, width, height
#  Polygon: poly, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, ...
#   It will be implicitly closed

base = ellipse, -165, -165, 330, 330
base.0 = subtract, rect, -165, -165, 40, 330

# Example on how to use sub-models:
# base.1 = add,mymodel
# mymodel = poly, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1
# mymodel.0 = subtract, poly, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1
